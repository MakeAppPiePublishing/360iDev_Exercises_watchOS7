# 360iDev_Exercises_watchOS7
The exercise files for the 360|iDev 2020 workshop 

Here is the code and assets you need for the workshop. 

# Agenda for WatchOS7 for SwiftUI
Here is the agenda.  It has changed slightly due to the info I got from the surveys. 

Given the environment, it would be nice to follow along, and there will be exercise files you can download. However, I understand that might be difficult online, and Iâ€™m not expecting a follow along like I would in a live, in person session. 

 If you do or want to play later, Please have **Xcode 12 Beta 4  or later**  downloaded to do the exercises. 
 
 If you have questions during the presentation please place them on the Slack channel for the course. 
 
 If you have questions after, I'll check the slack channel, but you can also find me
